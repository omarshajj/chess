## Game Instructions

*   Player Setup: Enter the names of both players when prompted.
*   Coin Toss: One player will be randomly assigned the white pieces, and the other player will have the black pieces based on the result of a coin toss.
*   Gameplay: Players take turns making moves by entering the initial and final positions of their pieces. The game validates the moves according to the rules of chess.
*   Special Moves: Special moves like pawn promotion, and en passant are automatically handled by the game.
*   Checkmate and Stalemate: The game detects checkmate and stalemate conditions, ending the game accordingly.
*   Draw and Resignation: Players can offer a draw or resign from the game at any time during their turn.
*   Repetitive Positions: The game detects repetitive positions on the board and enforces the threefold repetition rule.
*   Note: The game follows the standard chess rules, though we still need to add castling, the fifty move rule and our pawn promotion only promotes to a queen.
